    "We are facing a challenge in locating golf balls in an image taken over a golf course, which is meant to mimic a real golf course. The program should be able to provide the locations of the balls based on the input of a new image. We have a dataset consisting of 100 different images, each containing up to 14 golf balls. These images have been processed and bounding boxes have been added to indicate where the golf balls are located in the images. So our datasets contains raw images: \"images\" and labelled images with bounding boxes: \"json_labeling\".\n",

    "We aim to develop a model that can receive an image of golf balls and return the coordinates of their locations."
